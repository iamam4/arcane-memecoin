Its widespread use led to the creation of the Hexgates, a realm-warping device able to transport airships across Runeterra in an instant.
                        Crystals are shown to be extremely volatile and easily explode from just a little bit of impact. Jayce and his partner Viktor were able to refine these crystals and turn them into hextech gemstonesâ€”small, sphere shaped crystals (similar in appearance to blue marbles) that could endure great amounts of impact without reacting violently. With the creation of these hextech gemstones, they could be wielded safely by the common man and used to power up portable hextech devices.</p>
